# Internet Sppoker

This is an implementation of a unique card game that uses playing cards with additional letters and combines gameplay elements of poker and Scrabble.

The game was invented by four brothers from Elyria, Ohio, the Fujkas, along with one of their friends, Jerry Klein.

When this was first written, I was a high school student and Klein's son was my algebra teacher. There was also once a website, from which the custom decks could be purchased, but it is no longer in operation.

This repository is made available for historical purposes. The code herein is pretty bad, and there are a number of bugs I haven't bothered investing much time in fixing.
